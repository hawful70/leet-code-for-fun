# LeetCode Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to LeetCode problems, implemented in **Golang** and **Python**. I use this project to enhance my problem-solving skills and deepen my understanding of data structures and algorithms.

## 📌 About
- **Languages:** Golang, Python  
- **Focus Areas:** Data Structures, Algorithms  
- **Goal:** Solve problems daily to improve coding proficiency and prepare for technical interviews.  

## 🎯 Milestone Goals
I plan to progressively solve more problems with clear milestones:  
- [ ] **NeetCode 250** – A curated set of essential LeetCode problems.  
- [ ] **500 Problems** – Expanding to a wider range of topics and difficulties.  

## 🏆 Progress Tracking
To stay consistent, I will track my progress across different problem categories:  
- [ ] Arrays & Strings  
- [ ] Linked Lists  
- [ ] Trees & Graphs  
- [ ] Dynamic Programming  
- [ ] Greedy Algorithms  
- [ ] Backtracking  
- [ ] Heap & Stack
